# Meet The Rookie
Welcome to the documentation for MeetTheRookie!

## Generating Documentation
Documentation is *mostly* autogenerated as soon as you push to master.

The only thing that doesn't update is the API page. Luckily, if you're working on Unity you should already have most of the pre-requisites. First, make sure you have [docfx installed](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started). Then:

### Windows
Run `build.ps1` in `Documentation/docs`.

If you want to preview the docs, you can add `build.ps1 --serve` to run a local server. 

### MacOS/Linux
Run `build.sh` in `Documentation/docs`.

If you want to preview the docs, you can add `build.sh --serve`  to run a local server.

If you experience any bugs, let Tyler know.
