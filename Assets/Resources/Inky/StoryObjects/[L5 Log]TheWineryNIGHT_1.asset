  - Level 5 - The Winery, Night, Day 1
  - This Level holds both a Dating Sim and Gameplay. We start in the interior of
    Lupe's car during a Stakeout with Misra, outside the Old Winery. The Dating Sim
    can be cycled through, and at a certain point is interrupted by a loud, unexplained
    disturbance from inside the Winery. Misra is quick to get out of the car to invesitigate.
