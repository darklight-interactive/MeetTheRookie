Hello! Welcome to our Early Access Release of Meet the Rookie! We greatly appreciate your support in the development of this game, and hope to bring you more content in the nearby future. Before we begin...

*[Here is some context] 

Detective Lupe has arrived at Kettle Rock and stopped by a nearby gas station. As they tried to leave, a tree fell on the road and blocked their way out of the town. The detective has been told to go to a nearby precinct to ask for help, which is the scene you are going to play. 

Thank again for all your support!!!
